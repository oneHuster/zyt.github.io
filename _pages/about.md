I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore. Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

I am interested in the following research topics. Any practical ideas aiming to advance AGI from similar aspects are also welcomed. Feel free to reach out and have a chat!

Research interests
------
I am currently striving to (understand, interpret, improve) the (generalization, optimization, efficiency) of
- Transferable machine learning: Meta-learning, Domain generalization, Imbalanced learning, etc.
- General techniques for LLMs: Pre-training, Scaling, Planning, etc.
